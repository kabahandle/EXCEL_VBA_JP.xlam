# EXCEL_VBA_JP.xlam - Excel VBA Japanization.

## The Project of Excel VBA Japanization aimmings.

This Project aim to transrated Japanese langurage from Excel VBA's enghlish code, such as below

 - subroutines(methods)
 - functions
 - libraly functions
 - Excel objects.
 - Excel functionalities.

## How realize that?

I simply added classes which has Japanese name such as below

 - class sunroutines
 - class functions
 - class properties
 - class functions return value that is class.
 - code completion in also Japanese.

But I do not use class inheritance that makes code object oriented progrming.
Becourse I toucht that Excel VBA JP may serve only functionality libralies functionality.

It's simple. But easily and efficiently for developping code.

Becource It supported half done that is VBA class functionality, then, Object oriented programing by VBA, it's not usefull in the real.

## It's realy VBA?

In the strict real fact, it's not supposed VBA programing rule.
But to easy use, VBA JP is simple and usefull.

In addition, not only serving Japanase VBA libraly, but also english libraly, those are just the same coding rule.
(One only exception, Japanese function library is not supported againt english. but I'm look forward to implement in near future.)

# Excel VBA Englishization

Same code functionalities taht The Excel VBA Japanization serving functionalities, it serving to Excel VBA Englishization.
Same method, objects, classes sobroutines served by Excel VBA Japananization, to Not Same languages together in distingwithed language at the same time.

Then, Excel VBA Japanization is the bilingual.
